## Putting it All Together

Include here:
1. Your Arduino code.

1. `.stl` or `.svg` files for your "bopper" — if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.

I used lots of cardboard prototypes for the bopper. It was difficult to find the right size and right length of the bopper so that it does not get stuck inside the box.  I spend much time and energy to research online and find what is a good way to mount the servo and the bopper. After much research and trials and errors, I came up with the right size and shape of the bopper that can be used as the prototype for the useless box of this sort. With more time I could use either 3-D printer or laser cutter to to reproduce this bopper and attach it to the servo using the screw drivers.  Unfortunately, after spending days and much effort to come up with the right shapre and size and testing the bopper, this was all I could do at the moment. (but I feel I learned alot about prototyping throught this.)
